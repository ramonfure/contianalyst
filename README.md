## Overview


**Conti Analyst** is a Python-based tool developed to analyze data leaked from the cybercriminal group **Conti**. This tool helps researchers and cybersecurity professionals transform raw data from JSON files into Cypher queries, enabling efficient analysis of relationships and interactions within the Conti ransomware ecosystem.

## Features

- **JSON to Cypher**: Automatically generates Cypher queries from structured JSON files.
- **Graph Visualization**: Facilitates the analysis of complex relationships within Neo4j.
- **Data Exploration**: Simplifies identifying interactions between cybercriminals and their victims.

## Technologies Used

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org)
- [Neo4j 5.0+](https://neo4j.com)

This repository contains several scripts that perform a precise analysis of Conti victims in relation to the conversations released by @ContiLeaks in 2022. Specifically, the timely passage of the detected victims mentioned in the conversations of Jabber users is analyzed. and their relationship. In order to replicate this data analysis it is necessary to have the "contidb.json" file, which is an extensive compilation of all Conti victims, and on the other hand, the "unified_translated.json" file, which contains all the conversations carried out by Jabber users from the Conti group.


## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramonfure/contianalyst.git
cd contianalyst
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate Cypher queries from your JSON files:

```bash
python generate_cypher.py input.json output.cypher
```

Import the generated Cypher file into Neo4j:

```bash
cat output.cypher | cypher-shell -u neo4j -p your_password
```
